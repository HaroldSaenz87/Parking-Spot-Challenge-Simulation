# Parking-Spot-Challenge-Simulation

Terminal Based:

Determining the winner of a campus-wide competition for a free parking spot. Students, grouped by their garage choices, undergo two elimination phases: Phase 1, where each group eliminates students in a circular manner until a threshold is reached, and Phase 2, where remaining students across groups are eliminated based on sequence number and garage priority.
